# Find the Fake Gold Bar Game

## Overview

The "Find the Fake Gold Bar" game is a simple web-based game where you use a balance scale to identify a fake gold bar among a set of nine bars. One of the bars is lighter than the others. The game involves adding bars to either side of the scale, weighing them, and marking bars as real until you find the fake one.

## Features

- **Button Controls**: Add bars to the left or right scale, remove them, and mark them as real.
- **Result Display**: Shows which side of the scale is lighter or if they are balanced.
- **Game End**: Once all but one bar is marked as real, the game will reveal the fake bar and display the number of weighings taken.
